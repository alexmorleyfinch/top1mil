I once needed a list of the top 1 million domains so I made this wonderful piece of art.

It has a very specific use case and no configurable options, so it's likely to be useless to everybody.

But then again it's just another repo to have.

```
git clone https://github.com/alexmorleyfinch/unused-es6-imports.git
npm install
npm run start
```
